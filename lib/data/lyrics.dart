Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my husband
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance
'Cause I want this to be something
Straight out of a Hollywood movie
I see you standing there
In your hulk outerwear
And all I can think
Is where is the ring
'Cause I know you wanna ask
Scared the moment will pass
I can see it in your eyes
Just take me by surprise
And all my friends they tell me they see
You're planning to get on one knee
But I want it to be out of the blue
So make sure I have no clue
When you ask
Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my husband
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000

Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty? (Uh-huh-uh)
But I hit right back 'cause you got that, that, yeah
Why you always wanna act like lovers?
But you never wanna be each other's (uh-huh-uh)
I say don't look back but I go right back, yeah
All of a sudden, I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away

const toxic= '''
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

const outoftime= '''
I've been thinkin' maybe
Things were never the way we made 'em out to be
How we thought they were, lately, I'm not sure
One thing for sure
Is when we're together
We're toxic as ever
Make no mistake, all the roads lead
To we shouldn't be together

const stan = '''
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

const falling = '''
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left
